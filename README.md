> We're in the early stages of C:S2 modding and the tooling is not ready yet so please take this mod as it is and accept any issue.

This mod enables both **quays**, **retaining walls** and **elevated** upgrade options in the Network Upgrade tool.

> [!WARNING]  
> This mod might mess up your save game. If this happens and some of your roads are acting weird you can bulldoze and recreate them to fix any issue.
