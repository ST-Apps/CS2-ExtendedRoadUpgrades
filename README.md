# Cities: Skylines 2 - Extended Road Upgrades

This mod enables both **quays** and **retaining walls** in the Network Upgrade tool.

> We're in the early stages of C:S2 modding and the tooling is not ready yet so please take this mod as it is and accept any issue.
>
> This mod might mess up your save game. If this happens and some of your roads are acting weird you can bulldoze and recreate them to fix any issue.

# Usage

You will find two new icons in the Road Upgrade menu, just after the _Grass_ one.

Select either the _Quay_ or the _Retaining Wall_ and upgrade your roads as you would with the other available upgrades.
