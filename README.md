# Cities: Skylines 2 - Extended Road Upgrades

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We're in the early stages of C:S2 modding and the tooling is not ready yet so please take this mod as it is and accept any issue.

This mod enables both **quays**, **retaining walls** and **elevated** upgrade options in the Network Upgrade tool.

> [!WARNING]  
> This mod might mess up your save game. If this happens and some of your roads are acting weird you can bulldoze and recreate them to fix any issue.

Simply download the release from the [releases](https://github.com/ST-Apps/CS2-ExtendedRoadUpgrades/releases) page and extract the ZIP file to your `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to have some debug output, please download the `_Debug.zip` version from the releases page.
